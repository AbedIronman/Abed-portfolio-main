I realized that I could make a significant impact by ensuring that everyone followed the COVID-19 safety regulations. To accomplish this, I decided to leverage my expertise in microcontrollers and create something innovative. That's how I came up with Extremis 1.0 - a smart hat that alerts the user if they have a fever, reminds them to stay at least 6ft apart from others, and even prevents them from touching their face. With Extremis 1.0, I'm able to help keep myself and those around me safe during these uncertain times.",
